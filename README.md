# Cpp_timer
Made a C++ timer

used std::chrono to make high resolution timer.
this was already implemeted before but what i did was replaced 8 lines of long liner code to just 3 words

##start_timer : starts the time

##end_time    : ends the timer

##duration    : gives the duration of time

#usage :

##//start code

#include "ghanta.h"   //timer.h


start_time;       //starts time


//.....
.......
.......


your code here


.......
.......
.......//


end_time;         //ends time


cout<<duration;   //gives the duration of the time


##//end code
