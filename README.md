# Cpp_timer
Made a C++ timer

used std::chrono to make high resolution timer.
this was already implemeted before but what i did was replaced 8 lines of long liner code to just 3 words

## #start_timer : starts the time

## end_time    : ends the timer

## duration    : gives the duration of time

# usage :


#include "ghanta.h"   //timer.h


start_time;           //starts time


end_time;             //ends time


cout<<duration;       //gives the duration of the time
