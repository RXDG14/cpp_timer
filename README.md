# Cpp_timer
Made a C++ timer

used std::chrono to make high resolution timer.
this was already implemeted before but what i did was replaced 8 lines of long liner code to just 3 words


# usage :

header file   :    #include<ghanta.h>
start timer   :    start_time;
ends timer    :    end_time;              
show time     :    cout<<duration;
